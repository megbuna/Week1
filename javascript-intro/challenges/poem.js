console.log(
  "Do not go gentle into that good night,Old age should burn and rage at close of day;Rage, rage against the dying of the light"
);
console.log(
  "Though wise men at their end know dark is right,Because their words had forked no lightning theyDo not go gentle into that good night."
);
console.log(
  "Good men, the last wave by, crying how brightTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,Rage, rage against the dying of the light."
);
console.log(
  "Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,Do not go gentle into that good night."
);
console.log(
  "Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sightBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,Rage, rage against the dying of the light."
);
console.log(
  "And you, my father, there on the sad height,Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.Do not go gentle into that good night.Rage, rage against the dying of the light."
);
