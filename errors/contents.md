# Errors tasks

Work through the activities in the following order:

1. **questions**: Add a comment into the code predicting what kind of error youâ€™ll see - you can then run the file using `node <filename>` to check whether you were correct!

2. **challenges**: Run the file using `node <filename>` and see what errors are occurring. Fix the code as per the comments in each file and use `node <filename>` to confirm that there are no longer any errors!
