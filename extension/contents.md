# Extension tasks

Welcome to the extension section! Make sure you have worked through the core tasks before moving onto this section.

Please work through the tasks provided in the following order.

## Formatting

This folder contains a selection of files where the code is valid, but difficult to read.

Your task is to properly format this code so it can be more easily understood by yourself and other developers.

In JavaScript there is no single, correct way to format code, but an important thing to consider is whitespace, i.e. the spaces between and around sections of our code. Broadly, this can be broken down into 3 categories:

- **Spaces** - Spaces around operators and after commas
- **Newlines** - When you start or finish a new block (generally denoted by curly brackets `{}`), the next portion of code should begin on the next line
- **Indentation** - Inside a code block, code should be indented - like a new paragraph in a section of written English

## Problem-Solving & Advanced

These sections are similar to the **challenges** and **exercises** sections for the other topics.

Please work through them in the following order.

**problem-solving** -> **advanced**
